title = {THE EVOLUTION OF SWIFT/BAT BLAZARS AND THE ORIGIN OF THE MeV BACKGROUND},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We use three years of data from the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) survey to select a complete sample of X-ray blazars above 15 keV. This sample comprises 26 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 12 BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects detected over a redshift range of 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 4.0. We use this sample to determine, for the first time in the 15–55 keV band, the evolution of blazars. We find that, contrary to the Seyfert-like active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by BAT, the population of blazars shows strong positive evolution. This evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous optical quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and luminous X-ray-selected AGNs. We also find evidence for an epoch dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quiet AGNs. We interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion and jet activity. In our sample, the FSRQs evolve strongly, while our best fit shows that BL Lac objects might not evolve at all. The blazar population accounts for 10%–20% (depending on the evolution of the BL Lac objects) of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) in the 15–55 keV band. We find that FSRQs can explain the entire CXB emission for energies above 500 keV solving the mystery of the generation of the MeV background. The evolution of luminous FSRQs shows a peak in redshift (zc = 4.3 ± 0.5) which is larger than the one observed in QSOs and X-ray-selected AGNs. We argue that FSRQs can be used as tracers of massive elliptical galaxies in the early universe.}

title = {Cosmological Evolution of the Hard X-Ray Active Galactic Nucleus Luminosity Function and the Origin of the Hard X-Ray Background},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We investigate the cosmological evolution of the hard X-ray luminosity function (HXLF) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the 2-10 keV luminosity range of 1041.5-1046.5 ergs s-1 as a function of redshift up to 3. From a combination of surveys conducted at photon energies above 2 keV with HEAO 1, ASCA, and Chandra, we construct a highly complete (&gt;96%) sample consisting of 247 AGNs over the wide flux range of 10-10 to 3.8 × 10-15 ergs cm-2 s-1 (2-10 keV). For our purpose, we develop an extensive method of calculating the intrinsic (before absorption) HXLF and the absorption (NH) function. This utilizes the maximum likelihood method, fully correcting for observational biases with consideration of the X-ray spectrum of each source. We find that (1) the fraction of X-ray absorbed AGNs decreases with the intrinsic luminosity and (2) the evolution of the HXLF of all AGNs (including both type I and type II AGNs) is best described with a luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) where the cutoff redshift increases with the luminosity. Our results directly constrain the evolution of AGNs that produce a major part of the hard X-ray background, thus solving its origin quantitatively. A combination of the HXLF and the NH function enables us to construct a purely "observation-based" population synthesis model. We present basic consequences of this model and discuss the contribution of Compton-thick AGNs to the rest of the hard X-ray background.}
