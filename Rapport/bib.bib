title = {THE EVOLUTION OF SWIFT/BAT BLAZARS AND THE ORIGIN OF THE MeV BACKGROUND},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We use three years of data from the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) survey to select a complete sample of X-ray blazars above 15 keV. This sample comprises 26 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 12 BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects detected over a redshift range of 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 4.0. We use this sample to determine, for the first time in the 15–55 keV band, the evolution of blazars. We find that, contrary to the Seyfert-like active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by BAT, the population of blazars shows strong positive evolution. This evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous optical quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and luminous X-ray-selected AGNs. We also find evidence for an epoch dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quiet AGNs. We interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion and jet activity. In our sample, the FSRQs evolve strongly, while our best fit shows that BL Lac objects might not evolve at all. The blazar population accounts for 10%–20% (depending on the evolution of the BL Lac objects) of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) in the 15–55 keV band. We find that FSRQs can explain the entire CXB emission for energies above 500 keV solving the mystery of the generation of the MeV background. The evolution of luminous FSRQs shows a peak in redshift (zc = 4.3 ± 0.5) which is larger than the one observed in QSOs and X-ray-selected AGNs. We argue that FSRQs can be used as tracers of massive elliptical galaxies in the early universe.}

title = {Cosmological Evolution of the Hard X-Ray Active Galactic Nucleus Luminosity Function and the Origin of the Hard X-Ray Background},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We investigate the cosmological evolution of the hard X-ray luminosity function (HXLF) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the 2-10 keV luminosity range of 1041.5-1046.5 ergs s-1 as a function of redshift up to 3. From a combination of surveys conducted at photon energies above 2 keV with HEAO 1, ASCA, and Chandra, we construct a highly complete (&gt;96%) sample consisting of 247 AGNs over the wide flux range of 10-10 to 3.8 × 10-15 ergs cm-2 s-1 (2-10 keV). For our purpose, we develop an extensive method of calculating the intrinsic (before absorption) HXLF and the absorption (NH) function. This utilizes the maximum likelihood method, fully correcting for observational biases with consideration of the X-ray spectrum of each source. We find that (1) the fraction of X-ray absorbed AGNs decreases with the intrinsic luminosity and (2) the evolution of the HXLF of all AGNs (including both type I and type II AGNs) is best described with a luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) where the cutoff redshift increases with the luminosity. Our results directly constrain the evolution of AGNs that produce a major part of the hard X-ray background, thus solving its origin quantitatively. A combination of the HXLF and the NH function enables us to construct a purely "observation-based" population synthesis model. We present basic consequences of this model and discuss the contribution of Compton-thick AGNs to the rest of the hard X-ray background.}

    abstract = { The origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is still unknown. The discovery of their sources is expected to reveal the workings of the most energetic astrophysical accelerators in the Universe. Current observations show a spectrum consistent with an origin in extragalactic astrophysical sources. Candidate sources range from the birth of compact objects to explosions related to gamma-ray bursts or to events in active galaxies. We discuss the main effects of propagation from cosmologically distant sources, including interactions with cosmic background radiation and magnetic fields. We examine possible acceleration mechanisms leading to a survey of candidate sources and their signatures. New questions arise from an observed hint of sky anisotropies and an unexpected evolution of composition indicators. Future observations may reach the necessary sensitivity to achieve charged particle astronomy and to observe ultrahigh-energy photons and neutrinos, which may further illuminate the workings of the Universe at these extreme energies. In addition to fostering a new understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, the study of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays can constrain the structure of the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields as well as probe particle interactions at energies orders of magnitude higher than achieved in terrestrial accelerators. }

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We present a measurement of the high-energy astrophysical muon–neutrino flux with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The measurement uses a high-purity selection of 650k neutrino-induced muon tracks from the northern celestial hemisphere, corresponding to 9.5 yr of experimental data. With respect to previous publications, the measurement is improved by the increased size of the event sample and the extended model testing beyond simple power-law hypotheses. An updated treatment of systematic uncertainties and atmospheric background fluxes has been implemented based on recent models. The best-fit single power-law parameterization for the astrophysical energy spectrum results in a normalization of  and a spectral index , constrained in the energy range from 15 TeV to 5 PeV. The model tests include a single power law with a spectral cutoff at high energies, a log-parabola model, several source-class-specific flux predictions from the literature, and a model-independent spectral unfolding. The data are consistent with a single power-law hypothesis, however, spectra with softening above one PeV are statistically more favorable at a two-sigma level.}
